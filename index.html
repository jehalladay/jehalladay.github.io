                I'm a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and have been practicing
                ethical hacking since I was a graduate student at New Mexico
                Tech (NMT).
            </p>
            <p>
                I discovered and responsibly disclosed several critical security
                flaws in a web application used by a major health insurance
                provider in Colorado and "hopefully" helped protecting
                electronic personal health(EPH) information of tens of thousands of
                Coloradoans.

                I enjoy riding my Honda Phantom when I can. I've travelled to almost all of
                the very beautiful Western Colorado towns on my motorcycle, and looking forward to ride to many more!

                I love outdoor activities. One of my goals is to hike as many
                14ers as possible in Colorado!

                I did an epic trek to the Everest Base Camp and Chhola and Renjo
                Passes of Khumbu region of Nepal along with 3 friends in the
                Spring 2018. One of my bucket list of things to do!
